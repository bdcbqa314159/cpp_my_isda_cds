# Working with the ISDA-CDS model

We are taking the original code and giving it a new life with latest c++, excel and adding on top a python interface.

As noted from the original code:
This application is based on the ISDA CDS Standard Model (version 1.8.3), developed and supported in collaboration with Markit Group Ltd.
